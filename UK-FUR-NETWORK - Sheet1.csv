HantsFurs,Southhampton/South Central,"The HantsFurs is the name given to a regional furry group centred around the county of Hampshire, UK formed in 2000. The majority of HantsFurs members reside in two of the major cities in the area, Southampton or Portsmouth, however the number of members in other large towns such as Basingstoke are growing.[1] The HantsFurs do not have an official schedule for furmeets due to the area covered, however meets do occur semi-regularly in both Southampton, Farnborough and Basingstoke organised via the UKFur Forums[2]

The group was officially founded by SlyCat in March 2000 by creating the mailing list due to the increasing number of furs in the area. The list was used to create a community for the area to chat and organise meets. At its peak, it had over 120 subscribed members however the popularity of the list declined since the UKFur Forums included sub-forums for localised groups and as such, the list was deleted from Yahoo Groups as of 16th October 2012.

HantsFur meets are now exclusively organised via the UKFur Forums by whoever wants to suggest a time and place to meet up. Furmeets vary in size from approximately 5 people to over 30 in some instances.

In addition to the UKfur Forum Subsection, the HantsFurs have a website maintained by SlyCat as well as a Twitter account @HantsFurs which is currently owned by Vanillaaa on the UKFur Forums[3] ",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,Small
